## About the Project

The Multi-Agent Release Notes Generator automates the creation of high-quality release notes for a GitHub project by analyzing GitHub commits and pull requests (PRs) with a multi-agent AI system. Built with modern Python, it uses async I/O, robust error handling, and supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` or Anthropic's Claude) to generate insightful, categorized release notes (e.g., üöÄ New Features, üêõ Bug Fixes) with PR context.

**Why Use This Tool?**
- Saves time by automating release note generation.
- Enhances notes with PR details (number, title, URL) for traceability.
- Leverages AI to produce engaging, user-friendly summaries.
- Modular and extensible for any GitHub repository.

This tool is pre-configured out of the box for [firmsoil/slsa](https://github.com/firmsoil/slsa) repository but is adaptable to any GitHub project with proper token setup.

          GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_YourTokenWithRepoScope  
          OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YourOpenAIKey
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-YourAnthropicKey

## Usage

Generate release notes for any GitHub repository with commits and PRs. The tool fetches data asynchronously, retrieves PR details via GraphQL, and uses the specified LLM provider (OpenAI or Anthropic) to produce categorized notes.

### Command-Line Usage

Generate notes using OpenAI (default):

    generate-release-notes --repo firmsoil/slsa --from-tag v0.1.0 --to-tag v1.0.0

Generate notes using Anthropic:

    bashgenerate-release-notes --repo firmsoil/slsa --from-tag v0.1.0 --to-tag v1.0.0 --llm-provider anthropic

Outputs release_notes.txt and logs commits/PRs to console (e.g., sha=92afd8b message=Add SLSA verification pr_info=PR #123).

### Automation Script

Run the default script for firmsoil/slsa (uses OpenAI by default):

    ./generate_release_notes.sh

Configured for firmsoil/slsa with tags v0.1.0 to v1.0.0.

To use Anthropic, set environment variable:

    LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic ./generate_release_notes.sh

    Sample console output:
    text2025-09-22 01:XX:XX [info] Fetched commits count=97 repo=firmsoil/slsa total_raw=97
    2025-09-22 01:XX:XX [info] Commit and PR Summary repo=firmsoil/slsa
    2025-09-22 01:XX:XX [info] Commit details sha=92afd8b message=Add SLSA verification pr_info=PR #123 - Add Verification Workflow<a     
    href="https://github.com/firmsoil/slsa/pull/123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a>
    2025-09-22 01:XX:XX [info] Commit details sha=abc1234 message=Fix signing bug pr_info=PR #124 - Fix Signing<a   
    href="https://github.com/firmsoil/slsa/pull/124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a>
    ...

4. The release notes will be saved as `release_notes.txt` with categorized sections.

---

## Configuration

- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: GitHub Personal Access Token with repository scope to fetch data.
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: API key for OpenAI to enable AI-powered summarization.
- Tags for releases can be customized based on target repository.

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Automate release note generation when pushing tags (e.g., v1.0.0):

Trigger: Runs on tag pushes matching v* (semantic versioning).
Process: Fetches the previous tag, generates notes using generate-release-notes, and commits release_notes.txt to the repository.
Setup:

Ensure the repository is hosted on GitHub.
Add OPENAI_API_KEY as a repository secret in Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
Push a tag:

      git tag v1.0.0
      git push origin v1.0.0

Output: Check the Actions tab for logs. The generated release_notes.txt is committed to the repository.

Example Output (release_notes.txt)

    SLSA Release v1.0.0 (from v0.1.0)

    üöÄ **New Features**
    - Added supply-chain artifact verification (PR #123 - [Add Verification Workflow](https://github.com/firmsoil/slsa/pull/123))
    
    üêõ **Bug Fixes**
    - Fixed signing bug in GitHub Actions (PR #124 - [Fix Signing](https://github.com/firmsoil/slsa/pull/124))
    
    üîÑ **Changes**
