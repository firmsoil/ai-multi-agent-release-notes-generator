## About

Release notes are a critical part of software delivery, offering clear communication of changes, new features, and bug fixes between versions. This project refactors and enhances release notes generation into a scalable, async, error-resilient Python package.

It supports integration with the GitHub GraphQL API to fetch detailed pull request context for each commit, and leverages OpenAI's language models to generate insightful, categorized release notes automatically.

This tool is pre-configured out of the box for [spinnaker/spinnaker](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker) repository but is adaptable to any GitHub project with proper token setup.

## Features

- Async fetching of commit and pull request data with automatic retries
- Detailed pull request lookup via GitHub GraphQL API (PR number, title, URL)
- OpenAI GPT-powered release notes generation with contextual awareness
- Structured, categorized notes with sections for new features, bug fixes, changes, and documentation
- Extensive logging and error handling for robust automated workflows
- Modern packaging for easy installation and extension
